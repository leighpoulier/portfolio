# Background

For the last 20 years or so, i have been in the aviation industry.

I started out as a student at Swinburne University in Melbourne studying a double degree in Aviation and Business.

After gruaduating, I was employed as a flight instructor in Melbourne, based at Moorabbin airport, and later in Adelaide at Parafield Airport.

In 2010 I was successful in gaining employment at a major international airline based in Hong Kong.  I initially flew 747 and then later 777 aircraft to long-haul destinations around the world.

...That is, until a certain bat got involved and put a stop to everything.  The pandemic and its effects on my career gave me pause to reassess my life and its direction, and I decided flying was no longer for me. It was time to follow my other passion in life: computers.

# The next chapter

I am currently studing a Diploma of Information Technology at Coder Academy in Melbourne.  This bootcamp style course will quickly give me the skills and experience to enter the industry as a junior developer, about which I am super excited.

# Interests

I have always had a strong interest in computers, technology, and electronics in general, whether it be using, building, programming, gaming, or trying to understand how they work at the most fundamental level.

Apart from computers, I am also an amateur baker and p√¢tissier, and I also enjoy cycling, cryptic crosswords, Lego, and model railways.
